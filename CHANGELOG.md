# Changelog for the Garmin Connect Exporter

This changelog is inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## 2.3.0 - 2019-04-18

- changed: the HTTP request to login to Garmin Connect (the old one didn't work anymore)


## 2.2.1 - 2019-03-30

- added: new command line switch `--fileprefix` / `-fp` (courtesy of Christian Schulzendorff @chs8691):
  A downloaded activity file can now have a date/time prefix, e.g. "20190301-065831-activity_3424910202.tcx". This works for all export types (tcx, gpx, json and original).
  Existing downloaded files will not be touched. If downloaded twice, once with and once without the parameter, two files will be created.


## 2.2.0 - 2018-11-09

- added: new exported fields
    - `vo2max` the VO2 Max (maximum volume of oxygen, cardiovascular fitness indicator)
    - `aerobicEffect` aerobic training effect (value between 0 and 5)
    - `aneerobicEffect` anaerobic training effect (value between 0 and 5)
    - `averageRunCadence` average number of steps per minute. Excludes time spent standing
    - `maxRunCadence` maximum number of steps per minute

    - `gear` the gear used (only tested for shoes); nickname if set, the brand/model otherwise
