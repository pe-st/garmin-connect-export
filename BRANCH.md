# develop branch

The [develop](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export) branch;
it is the default branch. This is where my tinkering happens, and always contains the lastest version of `gcexport.py`

Other notable branches in this repo:

- [master](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export/tree/master)
  Copy of the master branch of **@moderation**'s repo, kept for reference and comparison purposes
- [revert-csv-to-kjkjava](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export/tree/feature/revert-csv-to-kjkjava)
  Backport of **@moderation**'s and my changes to the original repo, using the original CSV format ([PR 42](https://github.com/kjkjava/garmin-connect-export/pull/42))
