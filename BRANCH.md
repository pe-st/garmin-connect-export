# develop branch

The [master](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export) branch;
it is the default branch. This is where my tinkering happens, and always contains the latest version of `gcexport.py`

Other notable branches in this repo:

- [develop](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export/tree/develop)
  Former develop branch of my repo, kept for for the time being for compatibility
  for the existing clones of my repo out there somewhere
- [moderation](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export/tree/moderation)
  Copy of the master branch of **@moderation**'s repo, kept for reference and comparison purposes
- [revert-csv-to-kjkjava](https://github.com/pe-st/garmin-connect-export/tree/feature/revert-csv-to-kjkjava)
  Backport of **@moderation**'s and my changes to the original repo, using the original CSV format ([PR 42](https://github.com/kjkjava/garmin-connect-export/pull/42))
